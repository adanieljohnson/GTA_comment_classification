"9303","I would average all the values for controls together and the experimentals together and display this as a graph.",3,3
"9304","Should go in the results. Avoid repeating words. You could say this without repeating the sentence for figure 1",3,2
"9305","Good explanation but why? You hypothesized a lessening in the contraction amplitude.  (explain why  in the discussion)",4,4
"9306","Calcium enzymes? Or, proteins affected by calcium?",4,2
"9307","Tie this back to importance of study.",4,4
"9308","What statistical test did you use to analyze your data?",3,3
"9309","Due to the uncertain nature of science, avoid words such as “correct” as your data can be interpreted differently by others. As such, I would use “supported”",2,2
"9310","How might carbon fixation later in photosynthesis affect this first part (light-dep) photosynthesis?",4,2
"9311","What about standard deviation?",3,3
"9312","it should in theory only be +/- 1 standard deviation. The error bars don’t look totally centered on each of the bars, so I’m wondering if they were put in correctly in Excel",3,3
"9313","This introduction doesn’t really flow the way it should. Start with a broad beginning talking about the neuromuscular system, then introduce your study organism, then talk about what specifically you will be doing and what you think will happen in the experiment.",2,4
"9314","Was this based on an axis so you could measure growth towards calcium or was it just general growth you were measuring?",3,4
"9315","Need to have the scientific name in the title, which you had in your first submission.",2,2
"9316","This is not super relevant so I wouldn’t include it",2,2
"9317","The error bars are improperly formatted",3,3
"9318","Missing error bars.",3,3
"9319","This is a good figure and sums up the other figure nicely, so you only need to include this one.",3,3
"9320","Good, just mention how many frogs were used in each average",3,3
"9321","While the absorbance values are inversely proportional to photosynthesis activity, percent change is directly proportional. Throughout the discussion either pick absorbance value or percent change and refer to p-value.",3,3
"9322","Error bars are not formatted properly.",3,3
"9323","Citation formattingYou need at least another source",3,3
"9324","Include the respective stats values associated with the figure",3,3
"9325","Error bars don’t show how high the average is. They show how far away from the average the individual values are.",3,3
"9326","Good job comparing to other studies. Focus on that in the future, instead of re-stating the results",4,4
"9327","What is the recommended incubation period?",3,3
"9328","This should just be included in the graph as the actual numerical value isn’t going to be a focus in your discussion.",3,3
"9329","y-axis.Can you be more specific? Something like this could be the y-axis.Threshold of contraction (V)",3,2
"9330","Just for the next report, refer to the BioCore Resource Guide to format your in-text citations.",3,3
"9331","I doubt that. Maybe it just wasn’t dark enough?",4,2
"9332","Since you have so many figures, pick the three that best support your arguments in the discussion.",3,3
"9333","The means and SDs you report in your caption are different from those displayed by the graph.",3,3
"9334","At what wavelength?",3,3
"9335","If this is a t-test, you need to report the results correctly. Annabel, I have written this comment on both of your previous lab reports, so I will copy and paste it again here: “Report results of your t-test as shown in the resource guide. Report means and standard deviations as mean ± sd.”",3,3
"9336","These are raw data and do not belong in your lab report",3,3
"9337","So the information you originally had here was good, I just wanted you to only take out the citation at the end of it. I won’t mark you down for it though because I think you just misinterpreted what I said",3,3
"9338","What is the next stage of development. Be more precise",3,2
"9339","I would just put your p-value in parentheses",3,3
