####Corpus Creation Using Student Lab Reports
(Random thoughts on a different project)

Text files for our processed lab reports already are structured so we can process them using Jerid's model for corpus files with inline meta-data. 

All lab reports have these metadata embedded at the front end of the document:

* Number of lab report in semester: first
* This is a revision.
* Date submitted: 2018-11-06 12:17:40
* Author of this lab report is: *Student's NAME*
* ID: R_1et5dvwqfl2ZCX1
* Course number: 214
* TA: *TA's NAME*
