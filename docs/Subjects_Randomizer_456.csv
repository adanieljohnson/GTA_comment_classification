"2298","Up to here it reads as if you only tested one pair of fish, can you be more specific? Can you also talk a bit more about your points system – how did you execute it in the lab? A one-tailed paired t-test will be more appropriate for your data. It accounts for the fact that you used the same groups of fish for both treatments. Re-run the test (results probably won’t change)",3,3

"2312","You need to talk about their explanation for these data. You also need to wrap up your discussion with an explanatory sentence",4,4
"2313","I like the idea of these graphs, however it’s hard to look for differences between control and treatment groups when they are on two separate graphs. One graph that displays overall difference in weight would be easier to read",3,3
"2314","Which further tests? You don’t mention the Tukey Kramer in the methods section. And, it’s not possible to have significant differences between groups when you have no overall significant difference. So you should make a decision on how you want to interpret the p-value (it’s right on the edge of significant, at p=0.05) and then either say there was or was not a significant difference throughout the entire report.",3,1
"2315","This is still not a strong reasoning for the data seen.",4,3

"2324","Ah, so it didn’t move directly towards the Physarum. Here it’s important to make that distinction in how you took measurements in your methods section. Did you go based on leading edge? If so, this data point would probably be inconclusive in the results section. Did you go based on a central axis upon which you took measurements? Instead, that’d be different.",3,1
