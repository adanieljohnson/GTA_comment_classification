"2268","Somewhere you should briefly say what this is",2,2
"2269","This is a good connection.Your introduction is sparse and doesn’t set up your research question very well. You don’t mention anything about resource allocation or phenotypic plasticity, for example. You should fill this out more by explaining these concepts, and then talking about why you think salinity in particular will affect R:S ratios.",4,4
"2270","R:S is just for plants, organism refers to all of life.",3,3
"2271","any time you have an average graphed, you will need standard deviation bars (The standard deviation error bar option on excel doesn’t work properly, take a look at the resource guide or email me to learn how to add it properly).

"2305","How might carbon fixation later in photosynthesis affect this first part (light-dep) photosynthesis?",4,2
"2306","What about standard deviation?",3,3
"2307","it should in theory only be +/- 1 standard deviation. The error bars don’t look totally centered on each of the bars, so I’m wondering if they were put in correctly in Excel",3,3

"2315","Good, just mention how many frogs were used in each average",3,3
"2316","While the absorbance values are inversely proportional to photosynthesis activity, percent change is directly proportional. Throughout the discussion either pick absorbance value or percent change and refer to p-value.",3,3
"2317","Error bars are not formatted properly.",3,3
"2318","Citation formattingYou need at least another source",3,3
"2319","Include the respective stats values associated with the figure",3,3
"2320","Error bars don’t show how high the average is. They show how far away from the average the individual values are.",3,3
"2321","Good job comparing to other studies. Focus on that in the future, instead of re-stating the results",4,4
"2322","What is the recommended incubation period?",3,3
"2323","This should just be included in the graph as the actual numerical value isn’t going to be a focus in your discussion.",3,3

"2329","At what wavelength?",3,3
"2330","If this is a t-test, you need to report the results correctly. Annabel, I have written this comment on both of your previous lab reports, so I will copy and paste it again here: “Report results of your t-test as shown in the resource guide. Report means and standard deviations as mean ± sd.”",3,3
"2331","These are raw data and do not belong in your lab report",3,3
"2332","So the information you originally had here was good, I just wanted you to only take out the citation at the end of it. I won’t mark you down for it though because I think you just misinterpreted what I said",3,3
"2333","What is the next stage of development. Be more precise",3,2
"2334","I would just put your p-value in parentheses",3,3
