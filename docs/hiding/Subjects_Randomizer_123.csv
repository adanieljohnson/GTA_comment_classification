"2287","Also, avoid “incorrect/correct” when talking about hypotheses, and only use “data do/don’t support the hypothesis”",2,2
"2288","In addition, I don’t think the leg no longer contracting is an error. Based on your expected function of tubocurarine, it’s expected that it would decrease muscle contraction or completely stop it as acetylcholine can no longer bind to its receptors.",4,4

"2308","You don’t need to go this indepth in the figure caption, summarize the results more than the methods",3,3
"2309","As you’re more interested in the total difference in mass rather than the change for each day, you could use a bar graph showing the difference between final/initial mass (Your current graph works too but, you will want to quantify the difference in growth in some way).",3,3
