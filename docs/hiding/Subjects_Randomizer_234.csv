"36","Another potential reason could be error in isolating the chloroplasts from the leaves. Recall that you didn’t actually record the relative density of chloroplast this time. Going through that step to ensure your sample actually had a high density of chloroplast would be an effective way to ensuring that you had chloroplast in your treatment to begin with.",3,4

"40","Rather than a table, I would show this data in a graph as the reader would be less interested in the exact number vs the difference in growth.

"54","How much?",3,3
"55","Not true. Getting an insignificant p-value does NOT mean that you did the experiment wrong. If the p-value is very insignificant (0.9, for example), then there is simply no measurable effect from the treatment you used, but that is a result, not a sign that the experiment was wrong.
