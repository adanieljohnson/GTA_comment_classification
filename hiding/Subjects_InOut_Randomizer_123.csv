"2287","Also, avoid “incorrect/correct” when talking about hypotheses, and only use “data do/don’t support the hypothesis”",1,1
"2288","In addition, I don’t think the leg no longer contracting is an error. Based on your expected function of tubocurarine, it’s expected that it would decrease muscle contraction or completely stop it as acetylcholine can no longer bind to its receptors.",1,1
"2289","Although you said their names right below this, you would still have to cite it as (Olorunshura, 2011)",2,2

"2292","Consider ending with a broader statement about why this type of research is important.",1,1
"2293","I wouldn’t say it was a failure just because you didn’t get a conclusive result. You should look up leaky calcium channels in the literature. They are a possible explanation cited by several other students in our lab.",1,1

"2306","Missing an outside source (Basic Criteria)",1,1
"2307","This seemed strange so I took a look at your article. Lidocaine could ultimately affect calcium release (due to the role sodium plays in muscle contraction) but it shouldn’t have any effect on creation of calcium ions.",1,1
"2308","You don’t need to go this indepth in the figure caption, summarize the results more than the methods",2,2
"2309","As you’re more interested in the total difference in mass rather than the change for each day, you could use a bar graph showing the difference between final/initial mass (Your current graph works too but, you will want to quantify the difference in growth in some way).",2,2
"2310","It should’ve been a paired t-test",2,2
"2311","Generally, you report averages of each group, and then state +/- the standard deviation",2,2

"2313","Did you weight the containers? Is that relevant?",2,1
"2314","You provided a lot of really good info, but I feel like I’m going back and forth reading some of it. Try to make more clear the info leading up to your hypothesis.",1,1
"2315","Citations are necessary in this section",2,2
"2316","Make sure to include an actual description of any figures. Only tables (Should be labeled as “table 1, table 2 separately from figures) do not need descriptions.",2,2
"2317","or maybe it already did in the beginning and then changed its direction, you can examine past directions by examining the traces they leave behind against a light source",2,1
