Major companies like Round-Up that produce glyphosate herbicides would have to change their formulas of several products which will be costly and time consuming.  It previously has been co mmon for those  within the agriculture industry to plant glyphosate-resistant crops so that they could use glyphosate to kill the weeds without harming the crops. However, with glyphosate-resistant weed species on the rise, this easy and economically effici ent process may soon need to find a replacement. Once glyphosate can no longer be used to kill the weeds and invasive species, there is no point in planting glyphosate-resistant crops. A new alternative to glyphosate and method for best keeping the crops s afe will have to be found [Green: 2016].",

It is expected that exposure t o a JH-mimicking IGR prolongs the larval stage. Interestingly, preliminary studies show that JH-mimicking IGR can aid larval growth at first, but then growth quickly levels off  [Johnson: 2018]. The fast, initial growth is   due to the fact that   JH levels rem ain relatively high during the first 4 larval instars; after this, JH naturally should drop, and the larva should begin to pupate [Johnson: 2018]. But with continued IGR treatment, a larva should never begin to pupate, as it has effects identical to a cons tant high level of JH. Therefore, we hypothesize that if Manduca   sexta   caterpillars are exposed to JH-mimicking IGR, it will make them mature faster, but then hinder them from pupating. ",

This process is responsible for providing energy to the ecosystem by harnessing the  energy of excited photons through chemical processes.

Within chloroplasts, photosynthesis occurs within two major steps, light-indep endent and dependent. This experiment focuses on the light-dependent processes, as it is the initial step in photosynthesis and our target for manipulation of photosynthetic rates. Within the light-dependent reactions, there are two photosystems, or protei n complexes, that convert the energy from excited photons into chemical energy.

Light reactions in the thylakoid and thylakoid membrane use photons from the sun in photosystems to excite electrons and subsequently create a photon gradient to then power the production of ATP synthesi s.

It has been conject ured that this influence by temperature is   due to the fact that   this is a membrane reaction, and that temperature change may alter the conditions and flexibility of these membranes (ROSINGER et al., 1982). In relation to this, differing studies have found  differing results and relationships with temperature for different species, specifically in response to chilling. Researchers believe this could be indicative of some plants being more ""chill-sensitive"" or ""chill-resistant"" than others (  Rosinger   et al., 19 82). In the opposite direction of temperature change, different studies have also found different results when measuring the activity of photosynthesis when the system is heated. While heat does seem to fairly consistently have a positive correlation with  activity, in that increasing the heat also increases the activity of photosynthesis, studies have shown there is an upper limit to   this phenomena   (Nolan &   Smillie  , 1976). Studies done by Nolan and   Smillie   demonstrate that after the peak of activity, there  comes a rapid decrease, at which point soon after activity shuts down completely. This indicates that at a certain point the increase in temperature ",

This process involves plants tak ing up light, carbon dioxide, and water in order to make usable sugars and energy in the form of ATP.  An important by-product of this reaction is oxygen.  Oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration in animals or any other life forms that require oxygen  and the combination of these two reactions make all life on earth possible.    The organism we used in this study was   Lactuca   sativa, green and purple lettuce.  This organism undergoes photosynthesis and is relatively easy to grind and centrifuge in order to  then measure the rate of photosynthesis.  Whether or not different pigmentations of leaves effected the rate of photosynthesis could have had huge impacts on how humans view nature   .  There are two main stages of photosynthesis, the light and the dark reac tions.  The first is called the light reactions because light energy is used to excite electrons which then power a proton gradient and generate ATP and NADPH.  This NADPH then goes to the Calvin Cycle, also known as the dark reactions.  This cycle uses AT P and NADPH to create G3P, which can be used as an energy storing molecule for the night when there is no sunlight available.  Both the light and dark reactions occur within different areas of the chloroplasts.  In order to best measure the rate of photosy nthesis, a molecule of DCIP will be used.  DCIP  is a dark blue molecule but becomes colorless when reduced to   DCIPH2",

The action potential spreads through the fiber, stimulating the release of Ca2+ from the internal storage site (the sarc oplasmic reticulum) 4. And finally, the release of Ca2+ activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten. ",

Therefore, it is important for us to understand the role of photosynthesis and how it functions inside plant cells.    As a complex process, photosynthesis happens in multiple steps.   Totally three stages    happen in photosynthesis, light-dependent reaction, light-independent reaction, and oxidation. The first two stages, light-dependent reactions use absorbed photons of two different wavelengths to generate reducing power in the form of NADPH. The light-independent reactions, also known as Calvin cycle, use ATP and NADPH to create 6 carbon complexes. Temperature influences leaf photosynthetic rates in both short and long""terms. In the long term, a shift in growth temperature causes a shift in the optimum temperature of leaf photosynthesis, which allows the plants to perform more efficient photosynthesis at their new growth temperature [Berry &   BjÌ¦rkman   1980].  For this experiment, we will use   DCIP    as our alternative electron acceptors that are easier to measure than the production of oxygen. By measuring  the activity of this Hill reaction, ",

Some of these, such as minerals in the soil are a result of other organisms and are considered biotic factors, while others such as sunlight and w ind are abiotic factors.

This leads to resource limitation, and in this   particular experiment   the limitation is sunlight of  different colors. Light at different colors such as green or red has a change in wavelength, which affects the way plants absorb the light.

Growers could alter plant environments in a controlled setting in order to obtain plants with the desired phenotype.   From this study, we can conclude that a plant possesses a considerable response to the biotic and abiotic factors in its environment. A plant's genotype does not have exclusive control over the plant's expressed phenotype. Largely, the expressed phenotype is determined by the plant's environment. Nitrogen, when in excess, is easily absorbed and the plant does not need to designate energy to retrieve this resource. As a result, the plant is able to allocate its resources to other organs such as the stems and leaves. With the additional resources, plant organs can operate with greater efficiency and achieve higher growth rates in order to survive and reproduce successive generations. ",

For plants, energy is captured and stored from the sun via the process of photosynthesi s. The energy that has been stored is then released by glycolysis in the cytoplasm and respiration in the mitochondria, in both plants and animals. Therefore, the most important metabolic processes carried out by living organisms are photosynthesis, glycol ysis and cellular respiration. Photosynthesis has three stages that run concurrently inside of chloroplasts. The first two stages absorbed protons of two wavelengths to generate reducing power as NADH, this is called light-dependent reactions. This reactio n also creates a proton gradient needed to drive ATP synthesis. Within this stage, photosystems I and II occur. In addition, light independent reactions also occur; the high energy electrons are stored as NADPH2 via photosystem I. ATP is then generated fro m the H+ gradient and are consumed by chemical reactions that generate 6- carbon glucose molecules",

The goal is to initiate a muscle twitch and record the response under different conditions. To do this we will use a computerized system called   iWorx   to administer a voltage to the leg . In response we will observe a physical twitch: a twitch is one single short muscle contraction [Johnson:2018] This system records the response of the leg in voltage that is given by the twitch, which will be our primary source of data.

However, the root/ shoot demonstrated a significant different. It had a p-value of .00367   . Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis. Our hypothesis was wrong. This could be because in the incubator it acts like a dessert depriving  the plant of water and there is not much light in the incubator. So, this could have been acting as a dark room.

The action potential tr iggers the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a storage site. This calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum causes the direct contraction of muscles. A muscle fiber is composed of thick myosin filaments and thin actin filaments, whi ch slide past each other, causing a contraction of striated muscle. The sliding of the filaments is caused by cross bridges, the binding of myosin to actin. ",

What does Caffeine do inside the neuromuscular junction and why does this lead to results like you got?,138,". A previous study states that caffeine affects the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The  study used frogs as their model organism. They examined and tested the effects of caffeine on frog skeletal muscle fibers. [Klein: 1990]. In a different study, the concentration of caffeine caused different changes in calcium concentration in muscles. Low  concentrations of caffeine cause the direct release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum while high concentrations increase the effects of twitch tension or tetany. [  Konishi  : 1987].

",369,"In many species, males compete with other males for access to female mates [  Clutton  -Brock: 2013]. Sexual selection refers to one sex selecting mates based on certain morphological traits present in the opposite sex, which often manifests itself in females choosing mates based on the presence of these traits [  Prum  : 2012]. Males across many species have evolved complex structures that aid them in their competition for access to females [  Prum  : 2012]. While these structures do not always add a clear benefit to the overall survival of the organism in question, the presence of these structures does confer an advantage in terms of sexual selection [  Prum  : 2012]. Once females have chosen a mate with these favored traits, the traits are then passed down and gain prevalence within future generations of that species, contributing to the sexual dimorphism of that species [De Lisle: 2017]. Certain behaviors that can aid in reproductive fitness are known as performance traits, which may or may not confer an advantage in regard to natural selection",

How is it helping tell the story you want to tell?,72,"Photosynthesis is the process plants use to convert light energy into chemical energy to produce glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplast and consists of 3 stages: 1) light-dependent photosystem I (PSI), 2) light-dependent photosystem II (PSII), and 3) light-independent Calvin-Benson Cycle. During the light-dependent reaction, PSII absorbs light energy causing electrons to leave the chlorophyll. The electrons are carried by plastoquinone (Q) to the cytochrome b6-f complex, which then passes the electron to   plastocyanin   (  pC  ). PSI also absorbs light energy and excites electrons in the chlorophyll. These electrons are then passed to ferredoxin (  Fd  ) which triggers ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) to reduce NADP+ to NADPH. During these processes, protons are pumped across the thylakoid membrane into the thylakoid lumen. Protons re-enter the stroma through ATP-synthase. The proton movement through the ATP-synthase produces ATP. In the light-independent reaction, the NADPH and ATP produced in the light-dependent reactions are used by the enzyme RUBISCO to react CO2 with 5-carbon ribulose phosphate to form glucose. ",

The Hill reaction takes advantage of the idea that PSII passes electrons to alternative electron acceptors. The Hill reaction is: 2H2O+2A--&gt;2AH2+O2. The alternative electron acceptor, ""A"", used for this experiment is 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP). DCIP is dark blue in color and absorbs light at 600nm.

The special pair is passed on to an activated carrier called plastoquinone (Q). The electrons of the special pair are obtained from water-splitting enzyme which splits water to produce  O2  and a pair o f high energy electrons. Q carries these electrons to cytochrome b6-f which pumps proteins into the thylakoid space creating a chemiosmotic gradient [Alberts: 2016].     Plastocyanin   then carries the high energy electrons from cytochrome b6-f to Photosystem  I. Photons of light are excited in Photosystem I to activate another activated carry called ferredoxin. Ferredoxin excites FNR which converts NADP+ to NADPH. NADPH can be used in anabolic processes in the Calvin Cycle ultimately yielding glucose. This gluc ose can then diffuse to the mitochondria to be broken down in glycolysis to produce the ATP required for the cell to function. Additionally, the chemiosmotic gradient created by cytochrome b6-f mentioned before allows protons pumped into the  thylakoid spac e to move down their gradient through a protein complex called ATP synthase. ATP synthase produces ATP necessary for survival as well [Alberts: 2016].   The passage of the high energy electrons captured from light from one activated carrier to another is d ue to the differences in electron affinity moving from lower to higher affinities. The process from Photosystem II through ATP synthase is said to be light dependent because it requires the high energy electrons captured from light for the cascade to occur . On the contrary, the Calvin Cycle are the light-independent reactions.  Therefore, the ability of the activated carrier to remain in increasing electron affinity is absolutely crucial to sustaining plant life because without the successful passage of ele ctrons to yield NADPH the cell would not be able to survive. The vast majority of ATP that is necessary to fuel the cell is produced when the glucose diffuses from the Calvin Cycle to the mitochondria to be broken down in glycolysis. Far more ATP is produc ed in this cycle than the simple cascade from Photosystem II to ATP synthase. Ultimately, the ability of the cell to produce NADPH to be used in later anabolic processes is one of the many necessary steps within this cascade that yields one of the most nec essary things to sustaining plant life: ATP.",

The study deter mined through analysis of other photosystem related systems that this dephosphorylation is at an especially high rate in Photosystem II. The study's theory is that this rapid dephosphorylation is an initial reaction to heat shock in plants [  Rokka  : 200]. Th e findings of this study support those of this particular study because this study found little to no chloroplast activity after being placed in the warm water bath around 40 ¡C and 55 ¡C. This study suggests that the chloroplasts used in this study might ha ve been dephosphorylated at their reaction center proteins as a response to heat shock.  Additionally, the data shows still some activity around 4  ¡C. This supports the theory proposed by the aforementioned 1980 study by William G. Nolan that although the  spinach is chill-resistant there is still a decrease in chloroplast activity at these lower temperatures [Nolan: 1980]. This indicates that too low of temperatures likely decrease the membrane fluidity to a joint where the membrane is so rigid that it woul d burst. The data suggests that there is an optimal range for chloroplast activity that is around room temperature. This is also in accordance with the aforementioned study that saw a decrease of chloroplast activity around 17  ¡C [Nolan: 1980]",

Once the energy is captured, a water splitting enzyme allows the electron to pass to carrier Q, releasing oxygen and protons into the thylakoid space in the process. Electrons excited by light pass via a carrier, Q, to carrier   cyt   b6-f, which is a proton pump that harnesses the energy and pumps protons into the thylakoid space. The high concentration of protons in the thylakoid space is essential in driving ATP synthesis [  Mamedov  : 2018]. These first few steps are known as Photosystem II. The next phase, Photosystem I, also uses light energy to excite electrons which are used by ferredoxin along with a proton (released by the   ATPsynthase   pump) from the stroma to reduce NADP+ to NADPH. NADPH is used along with CO2 to create macromolecules and energy the organism can use via the Calvin Cycle, which is the source of most nutrients for the organism [Johnson: 2018]. ",

In plants this form of energy is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is produced in the organism's chloroplasts and mitochondria. During the daytime ATP is synthesized in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplasts, where electrons in an antenna complex are excited by   ultraviolet rays    from the sun. This energy is passed around the antenna complex until it reaches the special pair, which holds its electrons at a lower energy level than the other electrons in the antenna complex. This effectively traps the energy in the reaction center. The excited electrons are then passed on to an electron carrier. In photosystem II, Q accepts the electrons and passes them on to the cytochrome b6f complex, which pumps protons into the thylakoid space. An ATP synthase uses the electrical chemical gradient produced by the pumping of protons into the thylakoid space to bring protons back across the thylakoid membrane and synthesize ATP. In photosystem I ferredoxin accepts the electrons and passes them on to FNR. FNR then uses these electrons to synthesize NADPH. The electrons in photosystem II are replenished by water, which causes them to give off oxygen as a waste product. The photosystem I electrons are replenished by those from photosystem II. It is possible to measure the overall activity of chloroplasts. Specifically, one can measure the activity of photosystem II using the hill reaction. In this  reaction an alternate electron acceptor receives the electrons from the photosystem. One example of an alternative electron acceptor is DCIP, which transforms from dark blue to colorless as it is reduced. Therefore, one can measure photosystem II activity by measuring the absorbance when DCIP is used an electron acceptor. ",

These high energy electrons are passed through a series of electron carriers, creating high energy electron carriers and generating a proton gradient that powers ATP synthase.  Photosystem II (PS II) is one of the complexes that contains electrons which are excited by light in the electron transport chain, and reduction of PS II can be measured to measure the rate of photosynthesis.  In plants, PS II passes electrons to plastoquinone which reduces PS II, but in order to measure this reduction, the electron receptor must be changed from plastoquinone to a substance that is more easily measured.  In this lab, plastoquinone was substituted for 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) which changes from blue to clear when it is reduced.  This makes it possible to measure the amount of reduction of PS II, as a decrease in light absorbance at a wavelength of 600nm will correspond to reduction of PS II.

Next, initiate stimulus amplitude by adjusting the   LabScribe   to desired voltages and determine the threshold voltage. At this p oint we can test the muscles response to direct stimulation at different, higher stimulation voltages.

At no point in all this do you say WHAT effects you are curious about, or WHY you chose kale as a model in which to test it.",182,"Energy is a crucial factor for all living organism to survive. Plants, like animals, also have their unique way of producing energy, and such a mechanism is called photosynthesis. However, photosynthesis is a totally different mechanism compared to the energy generation and conversion from food intake of animals. Photosynthesis happens during the presence of light, which is the photon, water (H2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2). The products of the reaction are glucose (C6H12O6), water, and oxygen, and glucose is the energy which will then be consumed by other series of mechanisms which are not the topic of this experiment. The reaction can be summarized as 6CO2 + 12H2O + photon----&  gt  ;  C6H12O6 + 6H2O + 6O2. Since carbon dioxide is an indispensable factor in photosystem, thus, it is hypothesized that the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the environment with enough photon and water present can increase the activity of photosynthesis which increases the energy and oxygen production.   There are two major stages during the photosynthesis process, and they are collectively called the light-dependent reactions. (Johnson, 2019) The light-dependent reactions happen in the stroma, which is located outside the thylakoid membrane. On the thylakoid membrane, there are four major integral membrane protein complexes which can be used as a catalyst for the light reaction, and they are Photosystem II, Photosystem I, cytochrome b6f, and ATP synthase.  (  Alberts   , 2015)  For photosystem II and photosystem I, both of them bind to chlorophylls in order to detect various intensities and wavelength of light . (Gao, 2018)   In photosystem II, the electrons that are excited by light are passed to cytochrome b6f complex via carrier Q and electron transport chain. Energy is then harnessed by cytochrome b6f. As energy is transported from a higher to a lower energy level, the proton gradient is created. An accumulation of an excess of protons in the thylakoid lumen creates ATP because the only way protons can transverse the thylakoid lumen is through ATP synthase complex. ATP synthase complex can  synthesize ATP from ADP and phosphate using protons (H+). (Johnson, 2019) The other system is photosystem I, which is interconnected with photosystem II. Photosystem I pass the electrons that are excited by photons to NADP+ and produce NADPH. The system takes some protons out from the chloroplast stroma and adding a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. And as mentioned, proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane can generate ATP. PSI can then reset itself by replacing the lost electrons from PSII by using carrier   pC  , and PSII reset itself by replacing lost electrons from water. (Alberts, 2015)   All the organism that requires photosynthesis to produce energy requires the presence of carbon dioxide. However, carbon dioxide is especially crucial to the electron transport regulation in photosystem II. (  Shevela  , 2012) Therefore, this lab is focusing solely on the analysis of PS-II activity by using Hill reaction. In order to measure the activity of photosystem II, either reduction of plastoquinone or production of oxygen is required to be measured, but it is technically challenging to measure both of them. However, photosystem II also pass its electrons to alternative electron acceptors which can then be measured easily. Such reaction is called Hill reaction, which is a relatively easier way to measure the activity of photosystem II of the chloroplast. (Johnson, 2019) The alternative electron acceptor for the Hill reaction in this experiment is 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP), because its property that can change color, it can be measure by spectrometer and determine the absorbance. The   the   less color, the more photosystem II activity, which represents the more energy is produced. Kale leaves will be used as subject to produce chloroplast solution and be tested on. ",

DCIP is used to measure the activity by measuring the change of its color loss as absorbance of photosynthesis using the spectrometer. (Johnson, 2019) Kale leaves is subjected to this study. Its leaves are ground into solution and purified by centrifugal, then its photosystem activity is being studied from its chloroplast solution.   From the result, it is clear that the extra carbon dioxide in the environment has increased the photosynthesis. And as the increase of the extra amount of carbonated water, the activity increases as well. However, statistically, the result is insignificant since the p-value is 0.413. The insignificant can be explained by two reasons. One is that the time elapsed is not long enough. Only 10 minutes in between carbon dioxide is not able to see a significant effect from carbon dioxide. The second reason is that the concentration of CO2 is not high enough. Only 0.0005% to 0.0007% of carbon dioxide is added to the environment. In a future experiment, improve the two disadvantages listed above is able to improve the resulting quality. Carbon dioxide is clearly has a significant increase in photosynthesis until it reaches its plateau.

To quantify Photosystem II activity in the chloroplast, 130   mM   2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) was used the alternative electron acceptor for the Hill reaction. For the DCIP decolorization assay, one blank and three replicates for the control group and each of the three experimental groups were prepared for a total of thirteen samples (Table 1). All thirteen samples contained 2 mL reaction buffer (100   mM   phosphate, pH 6.5). The control group and the three experimental groups received 2 mL DCIP. The blank and the three experimental groups received 100  µL enriched chloroplasts. The experimental groups received either 5  µL, 6  µL, or 7  µL of carbonated water (Table 1). The absorbances for the mixtures were immediately measured using a spectrophotometer at 600 nm to represent time zero data points.",

Does it still tell a logical story (and the story you want to tell) without the sentence I struck through? ,166,"Photosystem II is the first step of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. In this large protein complex, light-energy is absorbed by an electron and is passed off in a series of discrete steps until a high-energy electron leaves PSII, pas sed  t o plastoquinone, which carries the electron to cytochrome b6f in a series of redox reactions, releasing energy in discrete amounts along the way and using this energy to create a concentration gradient of protons, which provide the essential proton motive  force which drives the ATP synthesis and the light-reactions of photosynthesis.  These redox reactions facilitate energy release by funneling the electron through a series of molecules with descending reduction potentials, thereby creating a slightly more s table molecule with every reaction and releasing energy which is used to create the essential proton concentration gradient.  In a system which is predicated on establishing a proton concentration gradient, it is clear that the surrounding pH will be of hig h consequence. The impact of both high and low pH on photosynthetic activity, specifically of PSII, has been well-researched. Past studies have indicated that altering the pH is actually a strategy used by cells to directly regulate the activity of PSII, d emonstrating a connection between a drop in pH below 5.5, the inactivation of photosystem II, and a wave of Ca+2 release from the ER[Krieger : 1993].  Other studies show physiological responses to a rise in pH as well, such as an inactivation of PS II acti vity above pH 9.3, which also elicits the excretion of three unidentified polypeptides from PS II [  Kuwabara   : 1982].

A mortar and pestle, a 150 mL beaker, and  two 50 mL centrifuge tubes were placed on crushed ice to cool. The central vein was removed from 4 spinach leaves, and the leaf pieces were rinsed with water and blotted dry. After the mortar and pestle were cooled, they were dried and the spinach leaves w ere added to the mortar, along with 10 mL of 400   mM   sucrose in a tricine buffer with pH 8 (cold grinding buffer). The spinach was then ground into a paste, at which point an additional 10 mL of grinding buffer was added. After additional mixing, the suspen sion was filtered through a cheese cloth into the chilled beaker. The suspension was then transferred to a 50 mL chilled centrifuge tube and spun at 200x G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. After spinning, the supernatant was poured from the first centri fuge tube to the second, and was spun at 1000X G for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was then emptied from the tube, and 20 mL of cold grinding buffer was added to the pellet at the bottom, stirring gently in order to re-suspend it. After  the pellet was re-suspended, 10 test tubes were prepared - 1 blank, containing 8 mL of water and 2 mL of pH 7 buffer, and 3 tubes for each test sample. The test sample tubes were prepared by adding to each one 100 microliters of the chloroplast rich suspen sion, 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130   mM   DCIP, and 2 mL of whatever pH buffer was used for that sample, either 4, 7, or 10.

I want you to push the interpretation and see if it stands up to scrutiny.,144,"Because the selected numbers for the r ange to be tested over went both significantly lower and significantly higher than these two bounds, the effect of the environment on the activity of PS II may have been exaggerated. It is therefore likely that the diminished levels of activity, which were  expected, would have been observed had the samples with pH 4 and 10 been changed to 5.5 and 8.5, accounting for the possibility that the pH values which were used in the experiment were too extreme, and simply halted PS II activity immediately instead of  gradually over time. It is also possible that the difficult to interpret results are simply the result of making changes that had too many variables to predict. As was previously discussed, the function of PS II at its core is to absorb energy from sunligh t and pass that energy down a chain of redox reactions in order to make use of the energy. However, the series of redox reactions that take place are numerous and complex, and it has been shown that the reduction potentials of the electron acceptors of PS  II are pH dependent [  Knaff   : 1975]. The consequence of this is that varying the pH levels of the environment in which PS II is active can have a wide array of compounding effects, modifying the rate or even the direction of the redox reactions which drive  PS II activity forward.",

Because its property that can change color, it can be measured by the spectrom eter and then determine the absorbance. The less color is shown, the more photosystem II activity. Kale leaves will be used as the subject to produce chloroplast solution and be tested on. Kale, Brassica oleracea var.   sabellica  , is green and leafy, which c ontains chlorophyll and can be representative for green leafy plants.",

Think about your words as a resource you are spending towards convincing the reader that you have something important to say. What parts of this section could be removed and not change the overall story?",341,"Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to synthesize foods (  ie  : glucose) from carbon dioxide to water. There are three distinct stages to photosynthesis. The first two stages are called the light dependent reactions. These stages use excited photons from light wavelengths to generate NADPH. The electrons from NADPH are used to create the photon gradient used to drive ATP synthesis. The light dependent reactions have two subsystems: PSII and PSI. In PSII energy from absorbed photons of light causes electrons from water to pump free protons across the thylakoid membrane to generate a proton gradient. In PSI electrons travel through a   multisubunit   complex from NADP+ to NADPH. This reaction removes some protons form the chloroplast stroma to add further to the proton gradient. Together these photosystems create and electrochemical gradient that push protons back towards the stroma of the chloroplast through ATP synthase complex which generates ATP. The third stage is the light independent reaction. This stage uses the enzyme complex rubisco, ATP and the electrons in NADPH to create glucose molecules from carbon dioxide. All of the ATP generated from these reactions is consumed by carbon fixation. Plants and animals can also carry out glycolysis in the cytoplasm and citric acid cycle in mitochondria to get ATP for cellular processes. In these processes glucose is broken down into carbon dioxide and the high energy  electrons released by this break down are eventually used to power ATP synthesis. The activity of photosystem (II), hence known as PSII, can be determined by DCIP decolorization assay. DCIP replaces NADP+ as the electron acceptor at PSI. DCIP is naturally a dark blue compound. However, whenever it is reduced to DCIPH2 its bonds are reorganized to conjugated C=C bond which make the molecule colorless. This color loss lets us measure DCIP reduction to DCIPH2 directly, as a decrease in light absorbance at 600 nm [Johnson:2018]. ",

In order to study a microcosm of this phenomenon occurring in California, the PSII's activity of spinach leaves in different salinity solutions was evaluated. It is hypothesized that a salinity solution will create a hypertonic environment in the chloroplast stroma which will cause water to move from the thylakoid lumen to the stroma. As a result, there will be little to no water for the water splitting enzyme to split therefore no electron in PSII for light to excite and not electron to reduce DCIP to DCIPH2. Therefore, an increase salinity will decrease photosynthesis which will decrease DCIP reduction which in turn will keep DCIP as a dark molecule and there will be a smaller change in absorbance. ",

However, when this analysis was broken down using the Tukey-Kramer test to look at the individual groups that were being compared, not all of these groups were comparable. The only groups that showed statistical significance between their numbers were non-comparable groups such as comparing the change in absorbance of deionized water at 10 minutes versus the change in absorbance of the 3.5% salinity solution at 30 minutes. Only the groups that were not comparable showed statistical significance. As a result, it was these improper comparisons that caused the   aNOVA   test to report a significant p-value when in reality none of the results were statistically significant.

This is mostly background you could leave out.,103,"Photosynthesis is the process through which plants gain energy. This process relies on the production of NADPH by photosystems 1 and 2. When a photon of light comes into contact with the antenna the photon is reflected through the antenna into the special pair. Once the special pair is excited an electron is given to the special pair from H2O and an electron is transferred from the special pair to carrier Q. Q is then brought to cytochrome b6f. At this point the excited electron is carried out by PC to photosystem 1, where ferredoxin is given off. The ferredoxin is taken up by FNR which converts NADP to NADPH Youvan.1987]. This entire photosynthetic process generates a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This proton gradient is then used to by ATP synthase to create energy for the cells [  Youvan  : 1987].

You handled the suggestions I made quite well. ,62,"Upon further research, it is interesting that spinach plants may have the ability to moderate their proteomes in response to salinity and other abiotic stresses, specific ally moderating presence of proteins functionally associated with several metabolic processes, including photosynthesis [Bagheri: 2015]. Spinach, like other plant species, can tolerate salinity stress  successfully after being exposed to low level of stress  for a certain period of time [  Pandolfi  : 2012]. The abiotic stress triggers intracellular calcium ion release to integrate stress signals into the plant's normal physiological responses [Bagheri: 2015]. One idea is that that spinach chloroplasts, even when  isolated, may still have physiological mechanisms to combat abiotic stresses such as salinity. Considering the salinity of the sample used was made to mimic that of sea water (3.5%) and twice the salinity of sea water (7%), it is interesting how the spina ch chloroplasts may have still activated those physiological mechanisms. If this phenomenon were to have occurred during this experiment, it would explain the lack of significant difference in percent change in absorbance, and thus photosynthetic activity,  between the 3 sample conditions. It is worth noting that the 30-minute duration of this experiment may not have been enough time to confidently point to this adaptation being a factor.   Pandolfi   and Bagheri, as aforementioned, noted an integration of stres s signals into the plant's physiological responses. This brings up the question of the time it takes for the spinach chloroplasts to modify their photosynthetic activity. Bagheri's experiment specifically, exposed plants to abiotic stresses for 7 days befo re analysis on the spinach leaves was conducted [Bagheri: 2015]. For future modifications to this experiment, the chloroplasts can be kept in the saline solution for a longer duration of time before the DCIP is added.   The results of this experiment, alth ough fairly imprecise, do pose questions about how plants respond to abiotic stresses. For further directions in research, the concept of adaptation mechanisms in plants in response to abiotic stresses can be analyzed, focusing specifically on the mechanis ms present in chloroplasts that help maintain normal levels of photosynthesis in moderate stress environments. This would further current research of the detrimental impact of abiotic stresses on agricultural output.",

There are a number of stages to photosynthesis. In the light-dependent reactions, an electron is first excited by light in the protein complex, photosystem II, located on the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. This excited electron is then used to generate a proton gradient which ultimately powers ATP synthesis. At the end of this pathway the electron passes through photosystem I and is finally accepted by NADP+, which is reduced to NADPH. In the light-independent reactions, the enzyme rubisco uses ATP and NADPH from the light dependent reactions to produce beta-carbon glucose molecules. Both the light dependent and independent reactions are carried out in the chloroplast which is a specialized organelle in a plant cell. ",

Just before beginning the assay, 100   ë_L   of the previously prepared enriched chloroplasts were added to all tubes and mixed. After quickly transferring to microcuvettes, the spectrophotometer that was pre-set to 600 nm was zeroed using the ""blank"" sample. Immediately after, the absorbance of all the samples was measured are recorded as the time zero data set. All samples were placed in corresponding environmental temperatures: ice bath ~4‰ãÄ, room temperature ~22‰ãÄ, a water bath set to 40‰ãÄ, and a water bath set to 55‰ãÄ. Every  cuvette was under the same intensity of light from a light lamp, including the blank. After 10 minutes, the spectrophotometer was blanked with the blank sample. Then the absorbance of each sample was taken again at 600 nm and then immediately put back into their corresponding temperature environments. Absorbances were recorded after another 10 minutes (20 minutes total) and one final time after another 10 minutes (30 minutes total).

Thus, the statistical analysis supports the null hypothesis, that there is no discernible difference in the activity of PS II a cross a spectrum from pH 4 to 10.

It is therefore likely that the diminished levels of activ ity, which were expected, would have been observed had the samples with pH 4 and 10 been changed to 5.5 and 8.5, accounting for the possibility that the pH values which were used in the experiment were too extreme, and simply halted PS II activity immediat ely instead of gradually over time. It is also possible that the difficult to interpret results are simply the result of making changes that had too many variables to predict. As was previously discussed, the function of PS II at its core is to absorb ener gy from sunlight and pass that energy down a chain of redox reactions in order to make use of the energy. However, the series of redox reactions that take place are numerous and complex, and it has been shown that the reduction potentials of the electron a cceptors of PS II are pH dependent [  Knaff   : 1975]. The consequence of this is that varying the pH levels of the environment in which PS II is active can have a wide array of compounding effects, modifying the rate or even the direction of the redox reactio ns which drive PS II activity forward.

The results were not statistically significant, although the mean difference of the caterpillars given distilled water was higher than that of the caterpillars given azadirachtin. Azadirachtin acts as an insect growth regulator, so by introducing it into the caterpillar's food we intended to prevent them from growing and pupating. This was prevalent in the fact that, while not statistically significant, the azadirachtin-treated caterpillars had an average growth difference that was 0.3 less than that of the control caterpillars. AzaGuard did not prevent growth in a way that cannot be explained by chance, but the caterpillars who had AzaGuard in their food did grow less in length on average compared to the caterpillars who did not consume AzaGuard.

Neurotransmitters are,   by definition a   chemical substance that is released at the end of a nerve fiber by the arrival of a nerve impulse and, by diffusing across the synapse or junction, causes the transfer of the impulse to  another nerve fiber, a muscle fiber, or some other structure. Due to their autonomy, like other animals, one of the neurotransmitters that controls their contraction rate is the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine (  ACh  ).

By doing  so, a myogram (a visual representation of the different stages within a single muscle twitch) can be generated. The three stages of a muscle twitch are known as the latent period (the delay between the receipt of a stimulus and the response to it), the con traction phase (one muscle fiber contracts in response to a nervous system command), and the relaxation phase (the time for the muscle to return to its normal length). Overall, data on neuromuscular control can be determined from a myogram analysis. Factor s such as twitch threshold and direct stimulation, the effect of repeated stimuli on fatigue, the effect of stimulus frequency on twitch amplitude, and the presence/absence of a myoneural block can be determined from said figures",

Dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) is the electron carrier used in this experiment to measure activi ty of PS-II. DCIP turns from blue to colorless after being reduced because it becomes conjugated, leading to a decrease in absorbance at 600 nm. This is known as the Hill reaction. A proton gradient is also made along the thylakoid membrane due to the tran sport of electrons from photosystem to photosystem.

These myofibers are bound together with connective tissue, and the skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons [Johnson: 2018]. Motor neurons extend from the spinal cord to the muscle, and they branch out on the muscle in order to  inne rvate several myofibers at neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2018]. When nerve impulses arrive at a neuromuscular junction, they cause the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal [Johnson: 2018]. Acetylcholine then binds to its recepto r on the muscle fiber, causing sodium channels to open, generating an action potential [Johnson: 2018]. The action potential propagates throughout the muscle fiber, causing calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Johnson: 2018]. This releas e of calcium activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to contract and shorten [Johnson: 2018]. Various chemicals, such as sodium, calcium, acetylcholine, and acetylcholinesterase, can be added to the gastrocnemius muscle and scia tic nerve of Rana   pipiens  , or Northern Leopard Frogs, to create unique neuromuscular responses that can be recorded on electromyograms",

Therefore, a change in the amount of acetylcholine present would affect the neuromuscular response",
