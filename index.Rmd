## Overview
I am interested in understanding how students develop technical writing skills in biology, and how we might improve that process by applying data science methods. 

My current NSF-sponsored project asks if and how scripted instruction, automated support, and holistic feedback accelerates student development as writers. One specific aim is to see if changing the structure and focus of **instructors' comments** affects how students' writing develops over time. To assess this we must extract instructor comments from student reports, categorize those comments according to their subject and structure, then correlate the types of comments TAs make with student performance. 

#### \   
## Prior Work
In Summer 2018, we extracted and tabulated ~11,000 TA comments from >500 pairs (initial submissions and revised version) of short lab reports written by undergraduates in 3 different general biology lab courses during a single semester. Using an iteratively generated codebook, the 11,000 TA comments were sepparately classified in two categories:

* __Subject__: did the comment focus mainly on **Basic Criteria, Technical Issues, Writing Quality, Logic and Thinking,** or **Other** issues
* __Structure__: did the comment **Point** to an error without providing other help, provide simple **Copy Correction**, provide declarative **General or Specific Information** only, or provide **Holistic Coaching** that fosters student thinking and long-term improvement?

#### \   
Counts of coded TA comments were tabulated into a 2-way contingency table that provided us with a direct measure of the most common types of comments TAs made on student work, and a relative estimate of which elements of writing TAs emphasize most often. 

While classifying TA comments this way is informative, doing so by hand is impractical: 10-12,000 comments need to be scored EACH semester.

##Specific Project Goals
My project for the **Faculty Learning Community for R** was to create an automated comment classifier that could generate two-axis contingency tables comparable to the one generated using hand-coded data. This automated classifier will be used as part of the larger NSF-funded research project to:

*  Improve both speed and consistency when classifying TA comments across multiple semesters. 
*  Monitor how the types and focus of TAs comments on student writing change over time.
