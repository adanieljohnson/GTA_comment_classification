## So It Begins

This is a general landing page for your website for your project. This is just a launching pad for our community. Feel free to customise as much as you would like.

You can use this page to give introductions about what you are doing and your aims.

The structure of the website can be changed by manipulating the `_site.yml`. Font Awesome icons are available to use. You can check those out [here](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/).

## General Structure

We have provided a rough template for your website
- **course_notes.Rmd** - Write your notes for the class, try some code, work some exercises and use this as a virtual notepad for the items we review. This is a great way to showcase new skills and serve as a reference when you can't quite remember how you did something

- **pre_work.Rmd** - Use this document to complete any pre-work assignments.

- **project.Rmd** - As you might have guessed, use this section to write up your project

- **library.bib** - is text file that is available for you to put citations. You can then use these citations in the other Rmd documents. Also note that if you want to cite a package and want the bibtex you can do this by using the command `citation("packagename")`.

- **footer.html** - Go ahead and put your name in there!

When you are happy with what you have written for the day, go ahead and make a website out of it by using the following command in the console `rmarkdown::render_site()`
